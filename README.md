# autonomous_Vaccum_cleaning_Robot
Autonomous Vacuum Cleaning Robot  This project is part of the Experiential Learning Centre (ELC) activity at Thapar Institute of Engineering &amp; Technology, Patiala. During my summer break, I built an autonomous vacuum cleaning robot designed to navigate through a room using an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection and avoidance.
